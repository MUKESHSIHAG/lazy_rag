CHAPTER01STATE OF THE ECONOMY: 
STEADY AS SHE GOES
India’s calibrated response to the  pandemic on the economic front included three salient 
components. The first has been the focus on public spending on infrastructure, which 
kept the economy afloat by creating a strong demand for jobs and industrial output 
and triggered a lagged yet vigorous private investment response. Stronger balance 
sheets of the financial and non-financial private sector helped, aided by a decade of 
supporting initiatives by the Government and the Reserve Bank of India. The second has 
been partly a natural response of business enterprise and public administration amidst 
adversities, i.e., digitalisation of service delivery. The public policy focus and nurturing 
of processes and frameworks in digital technology greatly helped this irreversible and 
transformational change. The third has been embodied in the Atmanirbhar Bharat 
Abhiyan in terms of targeted relief to different sectors of the economy and sections of 
the population, and structural reforms that assisted a firm recovery and increased the 
medium-term growth potential. 
Global troubles, supply chain disruptions, and vagaries of monsoons intermittently 
stoked domestic inflationary pressures, which were, to a great extent, managed by 
administrative and monetary policy responses.  The fiscal balances of the general 
government—central and State Governments taken together - have improved 
progressively despite expansionary public investment. Tax compliance gains driven 
by procedural reforms, expenditure restraint, and increasing digitisation helped 
India achieve this fine balance. The external balance has been pressured by subdued 
global demand for goods, but strong services exports largely counterbalanced this. 
Global output is now somewhat more resilient than in 2022, inflationary pressures are 
shrinking, and trade is set to recover, should there be no further geo-political shocks 
or flare-ups. However, the chances of geopolitical disturbances and conflicts have only 
gone up in recent times.
The net impact of these developments has been that the Indian economy recovered and 
expanded in an orderly fashion in the last three years. The real GDP in FY24 was 20 
per cent higher than its level in FY20, a feat that only a very few major economies 
achieved, while also leaving a strong possibility for robust growth in FY25 and beyond. 
Growth has been inclusive with a reduction in unemployment and multi-dimensional 
poverty and an increase in labour force participation. Overall, the Indian economy 
looks forward to FY25 optimisticall y, anticipating broad-based and inclusive growth.
Economic Survey 2023-242GLOBAL ECONOMIC SCENARIO
1.1 After a year marked by global uncertainties and volatilities, the global economy achieved 
greater stability in 2023. While uncertainty stemming from adverse geopolitical developments 
remained elevated, global economic growth was surprisingly robust. As per the World Economic 
Outlook (WEO), April 2024 of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)1, the global economy 
registered a growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023, though marginally lower than in 20222  and average

The context in which the growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023 has been achieved is markedly different 
compared to the 2011-19 period. Inflationary pressures have been significantly higher on 
account of the persistence of core inflation. Global trade moderated due to rising geopolitical 
tensions, cross-border restrictions and slower growth in advanced economies (AEs). The 
muted trade growth occurred despite the easing of supply chain pressures. Further, geopolitical 
developments and monetary policy changes across countries resulted in increased caution 
among investors, culminating in moderation in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows.

1.2 Both emerging market economies (EMEs) and AEs achieved higher growth in 2023 than 
projected a year ago.  Almost all major economies have surpassed the pre Covid-19 pandemic 
(hereinafter as pandemic) real gross domestic product (GDP) levels in 2023. However, growth 
has been diverse across countries, raising prospects of increasing divergences. Some economies, 
including India and China, have attained GDP levels 20 per cent higher in 2023 compared to 
2019 levels. Among AEs, the US witnessed continued growth momentum. However, economic 
activity remains subdued in the Euro area, although the magnitude of the downturn has eased.
1.3 The stark difference in the economic performance of countries has been on account 
of domestic structural issues, uneven exposure to geopolitical conflicts and the impact of 
monetary policy tightening. The economic shocks resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict 
had an outsized impact on Europe, leading to subdued growth in large countries like Germany 
and France. The US also faced high inflationary pressures and consequently raised the policy 
rates substantially. But, the pass-through to outstanding household mortgages was limited on 
account of the high share of fixed-rate mortgages and corporate debt being termed out at fixed

Economic Survey 2023-244rates6, limiting the impact of higher policy rates on economic activity7. India registered a steep 
decline in economic growth during the pandemic but recovered swiftly, aided by strong private 
consumption and government impetus to infrastructure investment. China, on the other hand, 
had only a slight moderation in growth during the pandemic on account of swift policy actions, 
including a high vaccination rate8, but growth has slowed subsequently due to structural issues. 
Japan, post-pandemic, went through subdued growth but is expected to turn around in 2024, 
driven by a weak yen and improved consumer spending.

1.4 Apart from GDP estimates, other indicators tracking the performance of the economy 
also point towards growth resilience. Leading indicators suggest an upturn in global economic 
activity. The JP Morgan global composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)9 registered an 
uptick since October 2023 with quicker expansion across both manufacturing and service 
sectors. The JP Morgan global manufacturing PMI has been improving and stood at a 23-month 
high in May 202410.

1.5 The escalation of the Red Sea crisis amid heightened geopolitical tensions in the 
Middle East in October 2023 led to supply chain disruptions, sending ripples to global trade 
and operations. The attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea led to increased global 
transportation costs, reflecting the rerouting of cargo. However, the increase in supply chain 
pressures was transient and modest. Similar sentiments were reflected in the softening of 
risk perceptions. The geopolitical risk index, which spiked after the escalation of the conflict, 
declined thereafter.  However, geopolitical risks are still high and persistent and may worsen in 
the coming months.

1.6 As the supply chain pressures eased and energy and food price shocks triggered by the 
Russia - Ukraine conflict faded out, headline inflation across countries declined. After peaking 
11   PMI values range between 0 and 100. Value greater than 50 implies expansion. Values below 50 implies contraction.
Economic Survey 2023-246in 2022, inflationary pressures declined considerably in 2023. However, inflation is still above 
the target in many countries. The easing of supply-chain pressures in tradeable goods in 2023 
led to sharp decline in goods inflation in various countries, reducing logistic challenges. Core 
inflation remained sticky on account of services inflation and a strong labour market, especially 
in most AEs.12

1.7 The persistence of core inflation prompted many central banks to maintain policy rates at 
a high level or further increase them in 2023, except in China, where the government focussed 
on giving policy stimulus to revive the economy beset with troubles in the real estate sector. 
Many central banks have hinted at the peaking of the interest rate hike cycle in recent monetary

State of the Economy7policy review meetings. European Central Bank (ECB) became the first major central bank to 
cut its policy rate, invoking the first rate cut in nearly five years. ECB lowered its benchmark 
deposit rate by a quarter percentage point in June 2024. The Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) participants’ assessments also indicated rate cuts in 2024, though the projected 
interest rate cut in the latest FOMC meeting (June 2024)13  is lower than that projected in 
March 2023. Stronger-than-expected labour market data and persistent inflationary pressures 
have been a major factor behind the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed) reluctance to lower rates. As 
indicated in the FOMC Meeting statements, from early January 2024 onwards, communication 
by the Fed increasingly pushed back to dispel excessive market optimism. However, market 
pricing of various financial instruments indicates greater investor conviction in earlier and 
deeper rate cuts. This is reflected in the inversion of the yield curve (short-term yields are 
higher than long-term yields), implying investor expectation of future policy rate cuts. Financial 
market participants have also eyed a much easier stance, as reflected in the significant easing 
of National Financial Conditions in the US in 2023 compared to March 2022, when the Fed 
began raising rates. Expansionary fiscal policy and the easing of financial conditions have, to 
a degree, neutralised the monetary policy tightening of the Fed, leaving unanswered questions 
on the future trajectory of inflation and the  US dollar.

1.9 Despite strong global economic growth, as per the WEO data, the global volume of exports 
of goods and services registered a modest growth of 0.5 per cent in 2023 compared to 2022. 
The slow growth was driven by lower demand in developed economies and weaker trade in East 
Asia and Latin America (UNCTAD March Update 2024)16. High energy prices and inflation 
weighed heavily on the demand for manufactured goods, resulting in a decline in world 
merchandise trade volume for 2023. On the other hand, developments in the services trade were 
more upbeat, partly offsetting the decline in goods trade (WEO, IMF Database, April 2024). 
Recurring disruptions, especially since the Russia-Ukraine crisis and increased concerns about 
supply-chain resilience also contributed to the slowdown. There is a reallocation of trade along 
geopolitical lines, with rising cross-border trade restrictions. About 3,000 new restrictions on 
trade were introduced in 2023, according to Global Trade Alert data (IMF, WEO, April 2024)17. 
1.10 Concerns regarding geopolitical conflicts, high borrowing costs and global economic 
fracturing were also reflected  in weakening FDI flows. Global FDI flows declined in 2023 
compared to 202218.

A RESILIENT DOMESTIC ECONOMY
1.11 India’s economy carried forward the momentum it built in FY23 into FY24 despite a gamut 
of global and external challenges. The focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability ensured 
that these challenges had minimal impact on India’s economy. As a result, India’s real GDP grew 
by 8.2 per cent in FY24, posting growth of over 7 per cent for a third consecutive year, driven by 
stable consumption demand and steadily improving investment demand. On the supply side, 
gross value added (GVA) at 2011-12 prices grew by 7.2 per cent in FY24, with growth remaining 
broad-based. Net taxes at constant (2011-12) prices grew by 19.1 per cent in FY24, aided by 
reasonably strong tax growth, both at the centre and state levels and rationalisation of subsidy 
expenditure. This led to the difference between GDP and GVA growth in FY24.

sector continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace. Erratic weather patterns during the year 
and an uneven spatial distribution of the monsoon in 2023 impacted overall output. This is 
reflected in the marginal decline in total foodgrain output for FY24 of 0.3 per cent as per the

1.13 Within the industrial sector, manufacturing GVA shrugged off a disappointing FY23 and 
grew by 9.9 per cent in FY24. Manufacturing activities benefitted from reduced input prices 
while catering to stable domestic demand. The input price advantage was reflected in the 
subdued growth in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation, which led to a deflator of (-)1.7 
per cent for the manufacturing sector during FY24. Manufacturers also passed on the reduction 
in input prices to consumers, reflected in the sustained decline in the core consumer price 
inflation. The strength of manufacturing is further corroborated by the strong performance of 
the HSBC India PMI for manufacturing, which consistently remained well above the threshold 
value of 50, indicating sustained expansion and stability in India's manufacturing sector. 
Construction activities displayed increased momentum and registered a growth of 9.9 per cent 
in FY24 due to the infrastructure buildout and buoyant commercial and residential real estate 
demand. 
1.14 Various high-frequency indicators reflect the growth in the services sector. Both Goods 
and Services Tax (GST) collections and the issuance of e-way bills, reflecting wholesale and 
retail trade, demonstrate d double-digit growth in FY24. Financial and professional services 
19  https://tinyurl.com/2eekevhu
State of the Economy11have been a major driver of growth post the pandemic. Contact-intensive services—prominently 
trade, transport, real estate and their ancillary services that were impacted the most during 
the pandemic have emerged much stronger in the post-pandemic period, embedding greater 
technology and digital content in them and transforming the nature of the service delivery 
in India. The proliferation of global capability centres (GCCs) has also imparted resilience to 
India's services exports, giving further thrust to the sector.
1.15 On the demand side, private consumption has been a crucial and steadfast cog in the 
GDP growth. Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) grew by 4.0 per cent in real terms 
in FY24. Urban demand conditions remain strong, as reflected in various urban consumption 
indicators such as domestic passenger vehicle sales20 and air passenger traffic21. It is also reported 
that rural consumption growth has gradually picked up pace during the quarter ending March 
2024.22  As per the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, two and three-wheeler and 
passenger vehicle sales also registered an uptick in FY24.

1.16 Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) continues to emerge as an important driver 
of growth, as indicated in its rising share of nominal GDP. India is in the midst of a private 
capex upcycle that has been aided by government capital expenditure. As per Statement 1.11 
of the National Accounts Statistics 2024 released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme 
Implementation (MoSPI), GFCF by private non-financial corporations increased by 19.8 per 
cent in FY23. There are early signs that the momentum in private capital formation has been 
sustained in FY24. As per data provided by Axis Bank Research, private investment across a 
consistent set of over 3,200 listed and unlisted non-financial firms has grown by 19.8 per cent 
in FY24.

1.17 Apart from private corporations, households have also been at the forefront of the capital 
formation process. The growth in housing sales in cities has been particularly impressive, 
indicating that urban households are diversifying the deployment of their savings. In 2023, 
residential real estate sales in India were at their highest since 2013, witnessing a 33 per cent 
YoY growth, with a total sale of 4.1 lakh units in the top eight cities. As per real estate research 
firm Proptiger, new supply witnessed an all-time high, with 5.2 lakh units launched in 2023, 
as against 4.3 lakh units in 2022. The momentum continued in Q1 of 2024, witnessing record-
breaking sales of 1.2 lakh units, clocking a robust 41 per cent YoY growth. New supply has 
consistently exceeded one lakh units since Q2 of 2022, underscoring persistent demand-supply 
dynamics in the housing market.
1.18 With cleaner balance sheets and adequate capital buffers, the banking and financial 
sector is well-positioned to cater to the growing financing needs of investment demand. Credit 
disbursal by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) to industrial micro, small and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs) and services continues to grow in double digits despite a higher base. 
Similarly, personal loans for housing have surged, corresponding to the increase in housing 
demand. However, credit offtake by large industries seems to be growing at a lower albeit stable 
pace. These larger industries seem to be tapping the corporate bond market. Corporate bond 
issuances in FY24 were up by 70.5 per cent, with private placement remaining the preferred

1.19 Global trade growth slowed in 2023, leading to a marginal decline in merchandise exports 
growth. As merchandise imports slowed more than exports and services trade recorded a 
larger surplus compared to the year before, the drag exerted by net exports on GDP reduced. 
The subdued contribution of exports was more than counterbalanced by the pick-up in fixed 
investment, thereby continuing the trend of domestic stimulus seamlessly replacing external 
stimuli.

Economic Survey 2023-24141.20 FY24 also marked the year GDP reached levels projected by the pre-pandemic trajectory. 
A trend analysis in Box I.1 details how the overall economy and most supply and demand-side 
sectors have grown at a pace to erase any permanent losses in output and demand.
Box I.1: Growth in GDP, GVA, and their components ensure  
no permanent losses in demand and output
A permanent output loss refers to a downward level shift in the observed variable due to the 
loss in output capacity. This box item visualises the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic trends 
in India's aggregate macroeconomic variables such as GDP, GVA, private consumption and 
the subcomponents of GVA.

Source: Chart I:25 to Chart I.31 are using calculations based on Statement 13: Annual and Quarterly Estimates 
of GDP at Constant Prices, 2011-12 Series, National Accounts Data, MoSPI
In the analysis, six key macroeconomic variables at constant (2011-12) prices, i.e., GDP, 
GVA, PFCE, GFCF, industry GVA, and services GVA of quarterly frequency, have been 
deseasonalised using the X-12 ARIMA technique that decomposes variables into its trend, 
seasonal, cyclical, and idiosyncratic components. The deseasonalised variables have been 
visualised to understand where these variables stand vis-à-vis their pre-pandemic trend 
projections. A trend line based on de-seasonalised data between June 2011 and March 
2020 has been plotted and extended until March 2024. This trend reflects the approximate 
projection of the variable in each quarter from June 2020 to March 2024 had the pandemic-
induced contraction of economic activity not occurred.   
Economic Survey 2023-2416The visualisation reveals that GDP, GVA, private consumption, GFCF, and industrial GVA 
have recovered quickly. We see that the compounded quarterly growth rate (CQGR) of these 
variables is greater in the period Q3 FY21 – Q4 FY24 than the CQGR in the pre-pandemic 
period of Q1 FY12 – Q4 FY20 (Table I.). This enabled a broad catch-up to the levels projected 
by the pre-pandemic trends, thereby averting any permanent losses in demand/output. The 
reasons for this are manifold. The pandemic-induced contraction presented an opportunity 
for the deployment of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy that focussed on capital expenditure, 
thereby positioning government-driven capital formation as a driver of growth. It also 
enabled the implementation of multiple process reforms and the deployment of public digital 
infrastructure that boosted the ease of doing business. The pandemic also accelerated the 
adoption of digital technologies amongst the population and enhanced financial inclusion. 
With the GST and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) acting as tailwinds to the 
economy, growth took off.

GVA of the services sector is yet to reach the level projected by the pre-pandemic trend. The 
granular data available until FY23 reveals that this is on account of the trade, hotel, road and 
air transport sectors. These sectors, taken together, contributed about 28.5 per cent to total 
real GVA in FY23 and were only one per cent above their levels in FY20.   
Chart I.27 reveals that the gap between GDP and its pre-pandemic trend has been closing, 
and GDP was only around 1 per cent below this trend on an annual average basis in FY24. 
There is still some catching up left. The extant momentum in growth not only allows the 
economy to catch up with its pre-pandemic trend without stoking inflationary pressures but 
aids in surpassing it.
MACROECONOMIC STABILITY SAFEGUARDS GROWTH
1.21 For India, FY23 began with multiple challenges. Spillovers from the conflict in Europe 
were stoking domestic price pressures and widening the current account deficit (CAD) through 
increased oil prices. Central banks in several countries began raising policy rates to battle 
inflationary pressures, leading to significant uncertainty in AEs and EMEs alike. However, 
throughout FY23 and FY24, the focus on macroeconomic stability was vital in securing 
economic growth amidst domestic and external vulnerabilities. 
State of the Economy17Improving Public Finances
Consolidation of Union Government Finances
1.22 Against the global trend of widening fiscal deficit and increasing debt burden, India has 
remained on the course of fiscal consolidation. The favourable fiscal performance in 2023, 
emerged as the cornerstone of India’s macroeconomic stability. The fiscal deficit of the Union 
Government has been brought down from 6.4 per cent of GDP in FY23 to 5.6 per cent of GDP 
in FY24, according to provisional actuals (PA) data released by the Office of Controller General 
of Accounts (CGA). Strong growth in direct and indirect taxes on account of resilient economic 
activity and increased compliance meant that the tax revenues generated exceeded the 
conservative budgetary estimates. Additionally, higher-than-budgeted non-tax revenue in the 
form of dividends from the RBI has buffeted revenue receipts. In combination with restrained 
revenue expenditure, these buoyant revenues ensured lower deficits. A decomposition of the 
fiscal deficit over the past few years reveals that with a narrowing revenue deficit, a larger share 
of the fiscal deficit is being accounted for by capital outlay. This suggests that the productivity 
of borrowed resources has improved.

Buoyancy in revenues continues in FY24
1.23 Significant fiscal consolidation post-pandemic could be achieved largely due to buoyant 
revenues. Revenue receipts of the union government consisting of tax revenue (net to centre) 
and non-tax revenue (NTR) increased YoY by 14.5 per cent in FY24 (PA), with robust growth in 
both tax and non-tax revenues.

1.24 The growth in gross tax revenue (GTR) was estimated to be 13.4 per cent in FY24, 
translating into tax revenue buoyancy of 1.4. The growth was led by a 15.8 per cent growth in 
direct taxes and a 10.6 per cent increase in indirect taxes over FY23. Broadly, 55 per cent of 
GTR accrued from direct taxes and the remaining 45 per cent from indirect taxes. The increased 
contribution of direct taxes to GTR over the years has been in line with the government’s effort 
to enhance progressivity in taxation. The efficiency of tax collection has increased over time, 
reflected in the cost of collection of direct taxes declining from 0.66 per cent of gross collections 
in FY20 to 0.51 per cent in FY2326.

has been equally pronounced for both intra-state trade and inter-state trade. The increase in 
GST collection and E-way bill generation reflects increased compliance over time.

1.26 Over the last seven years, GST has matured significantly through streamlining of 
procedures and, in the process, enhancing tax buoyancy for the Union and State governments. 
There have been calls for further rationalisation of rate structure to compress the number of 
rates, elimination of rate inversions, introduction of broad-band rates for similar products and 
expanding the tax base. Demands also relate to differentiating between serious and less serious 
offences, spreading awareness among taxpayers regarding common mistakes, encouraging 
voluntary compliance and expediting the resolution of disputes.27
1.27 Within non-debt capital receipts, the proceeds from the National Monetisation Pipeline 
(NMP), which was announced in the Union Budget FY22, are gaining traction. The NMP listed 
core assets of union government ministries and public sector enterprises with a potential of 
₹6 lakh crore for monetisation over the four-year period of FY22 – FY25. During FY22 - FY24, 
receipts worth ₹3.9 lakh crore have been recorded as against a target of ₹4.3 lakh crore.28 The 
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the Ministry of Coal contributed ₹97 thousand 
crore out of proceeds worth ₹1.6 lakh crore in FY24. The National Highways Authority of India 
has identified and published an indicative list of 33 assets to be monetised in FY25. This will 
help improve capital allocation by investors while aiding the government in its pursuit of fiscal 
consolidation.

Economic Survey 2023-2420budgets moderated the growth in revenue expenditure. While achieving the compression in 
revenue expenditure as a per cent of GDP, the government also ensured that free food grains 
are provided to 81.4 crore people in the country. At the same time, shares of total expenditure 
allotted to capital spending were progressively enhanced, thereby improving the quality 
of expenditure. Government expenditure in FY24 continued this trend whereby, as per the 
provisional actuals, total expenditure declined to 15.0 per cent of GDP from 17.7 per cent in FY21.

29  Effective Capex includes capex and Grants-in-Aid for creation of capital assets.
State of the Economy21Capex has lifted the productive potential of the economy; time for the private 
sector to take the baton
1.29 The PA show that capital expenditure for FY24 stood at ₹9.5 lakh crore, an increase of 
28.2 per cent on a YoY basis, and was 2.8 times the level of FY20. The Government’s thrust on 
capex has been a critical driver of economic growth amidst an uncertain and challenging global 
environment. 
1.30 The focus of capex has been broad-based. Spending in sectors such as road transport 
and highways, railways, defence services, and telecommunications delivers higher and longer 
impetuses to growth by addressing logistical bottlenecks and expanding productive capacities. 
Government capex has also begun to crowd in private investment, as discussed earlier in this 
chapter. Additionally, the Government continues to disburse grants-in-aid for the creation of 
capital assets to the states, thereby incentivising them to increase their productive spending. 
1.31 At this juncture, it is important to note that while it remains the government’s responsibility 
to facilitate the development of infrastructure and address logistical challenges, it is incumbent 
upon the private sector to take forward the momentum in capital formation on its own and in 
partnership with the Government. Between FY19 and FY23, the share of private non-financial 
corporations in overall GFCF increased only by 0.8 percentage points from 34.1 per cent to 
34.9 per cent. This was mostly driven by their fast-increasing share in the additional stock of 
dwellings, other buildings and structures. Their share in addition to the capital stock in terms 
of machinery and equipment, started growing robustly only since FY22, a trend that needs to 
be sustained on the  strength of their improving bottom-line and balance sheets in order to 
generate high-quality jobs.

Economic Survey 2023-2422Revenue expenditure growth remains restrained 
1.32 The PA show that total expe nditure for FY24 is lower by ₹60.6 thousand crore as 
compared to the budgeted estimates. However, these lower-than-budgeted estimates have not 
resulted in compromises on important areas of revenue spending, such as rural development 
and education, where allocation is significantly higher than budgeted estimates. Efficient 
expenditure management, aided by lower borrowing costs, has led to a marginal downward 
revision of budgeted expenditure on interest payments in FY24. 
1.33 However, even though expenditure on interest payments is lower than budgeted, it 
constitutes 30.4 per cent of the revenue expenditure in FY24 (PA). A commitment to fiscal 
consolidation in the medium term, combined with revenues from asset monetisation and 
privatisation, will be essential in reducing the share of interest payments in revenue expenditure 
in order to generate more fiscal headroom.
1.34 Expenditure on major subsidies declined by 22.1 per cent on a YoY basis, led by a decrease 
in fertiliser30 and food subsidies by 24.6 per cent and 22.4 per cent, respectively, in FY24. The 
prices of fertilisers had steeply increased in FY23 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, prompting 
a higher outlay for its subsidy. However, in FY24, the supply chains adapted, and as a result, the 
prices of fertilisers have broadly returned to pre-conflict levels. This facilitated a lower outlay 
on fertiliser subsidies. The additional food subsidy, instituted to protect vulnerable sections of 
the population, has been gradually consolid ating as well.  
Overview of State Government Finances
1.35 State governments continued to improve their finances in FY24. Preliminary unaudited 
estimates of finances for a set of 23 states31, published by the Comptroller and Auditor General 
of India, suggest that the gross fiscal deficit of these 23 states was 8.6 per cent lower than the 
budgeted figure of ₹9.1 lakh crore.32 This implies that fiscal deficit as a per cent of GDP for these 
states came in at 2.8 per cent as against a budgeted 3.1 per cent. The quality of spending by state 
governments improved, too, with state governments focusing on capex as well.
30  Fertiliser subsidy includes nutrient-based fertiliser subsidy and urea subsidy
31   The 23 major states are: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, 
Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Punjab, 
Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal.

to the states are highly progressive, with states with lower Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) 
per capita receiving higher transfers relative to their GSDP. On the revenue side, however, 
the richer states, with certain exceptions, are able to mobilise a greater proportion of their 
GSDP as taxes. The combined result of these dynamics on the receipts side is that poorer states 
are enabled to incur greater public spending relative to their GSDP with the system of fiscal

General Government Debt
1.37 In the years since the pandemic, the Union Government and the State Governments in 
general have focussed on fiscal consolidation, which was reflected in the declining debt trajectory 
of the government till FY23. The general government debt to GDP ratio increased slightly in 
FY24 despite a declining primary deficit because monetary tightening led to a spike in interest 
rates, while the decline in inflationary pressures resulted in a lower-than-budgeted nominal 
GDP growth. However, with the increased prospects of monetary policy easing, along with an 
uptick in WPI inflation and the government’s continued commitment to fiscal consolidation, 
the debt ratio is likely to resume its declin ing trend.

1.38 Union Government debt is characterised by low currency and interest rate risks. This is 
owing to the low share of external debt in the debt portfolio and almost all external borrowings 
being from official sources. The gradual elongation of the maturity profile of the Union 
Government’s debt is leading to reduced rollover risks. The proportion of dated securities

GDP is RE for FY21, FY22, FY23 and PE for FY24.
35   The cost of borrowing is calculated as the total interest payments as a per cent of the average debt of period (t) 
and (t-1).
Economic Survey 2023-2426maturing in less than five years has seen a consistent decline in recent years. The weighted 
average maturity of the outstanding stock of dated securities of the Government has increased 
from 9.6 years in end-March 2011 to 12.5 years in end-March 2024.36
1.39 The sustained improvement in fiscal metrics is beginning to have an impact on India’s 
credit ratings. For the first time in 13 years, S&P Global Ratings upgraded India's sovereign 
credit rating outlook from ‘stable’ to ‘positive’ in May 2024 on the back of robust economic 
growth, sound economic fundamentals and improved composition of government spending. 
S&P mentioned that cautious monetary and fiscal policy that diminishes general government 
debt and interest burden while improving economic resilience could lead to a higher rating over 
the next two years. The agency further indicated that such an update would require continued 
commitment to fiscal consolidation in a manner that reduces general government deficits to 
below 7 per cent on a structural basis. If that were to happen, India’s 10-year benchmark bond 
yield will drop between 30 and 50 basis points. The drop in the benchmark borrowing cost 
will cause interest rates to decline in general, lead ing to overall lower cost of borrowing for 
households and businesses. That would be a fiscal stimulus in itself. 
Moderation in inflation pressure
1.40 Despite global supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions, domestic 
inflationary pressures moderated in FY24. After averaging 6.7 per cent in FY23, retail inflation 
declined to 5.4 per cent in FY24. This has been due to the combination of measures undertaken 
by the Government and the RBI. The Union Government undertook prompt measures such as 
open market sales, retailing in specified outlets, timely imports, reduced the prices of Liquified 
Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders and implemented a cut in petrol and diesel prices. The RBI 
raised policy rates by a cumulative 250 bps between May 2022 and February 2023. It also 
managed liquidity levels efficiently and maintained consistent and coherent communication 
with market participants. Even as higher policy rates are transmitted through the system, the 
RBI continues to support growth with adequate liquidity, thereby ensuring that inflation is 
headed to the target of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The effects of these measures are reflected 
in the latest data on CPI inflation – headline CPI inflation of 5.1 per cent in June 2024, and core 
inflation declined to 3.1 per cent. Consequently, India was the only country amongst its peers 
to traverse a high-growth and low-inflation path in the period FY22 – FY24 (Chart I.53). This is 
despite the fact that there were pressures on the food inflation front, driven by adverse weather 
conditions.

The financial system remains resilient
1.41 The RBI’s vigil over the banking and financial system and its prompt regulatory actions 
ensure that the system can withstand any macroeconomic or systemic shock. Data from the 
RBI’s Financial Stability Report of June 2024 show that the asset quality of SCBs has improved, 
with the Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio declining to 2.8 per cent in March 2024, a 
12-year low. The system-wide capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) declined marginally 
by 37 basis points (bps) over FY24 due to an RBI-mandated revision of risk weights but 
remained well above the regulatory threshold. The profitability of SCBs remained steady, with 
the return on equity and return on assets ratios at 13.8 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively, as 
of March 2024. Macro stress tests also reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with minimum 
capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. 
1.42 The RBI remains proactive in undertaking regulatory action. In a measure to regulate the 
exuberant growth in the unsecured lending category and preserve financial stability, the RBI 
tightened norms around this portfolio. Growth in unsecured loans was outpacing that in overall 
credit. To tackle this problem, the RBI directed that consumer credit exposure for banks and 
Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) will attract a risk weight of 125 per cent compared 
to 100 per cent earlier. The risk weight for credit card loans by banks and NBFCs was fixed 
at 150 per cent and 125 per cent, respectively, up from 125 per cent and 100 per cent earlier. 
Prompt regulatory actions shield the banking and financial system from adverse developments 
and instil confidence in market participants. The soundness of the banking system will facilitate 
the financing of productive opportunities and lengthen the financial cycle, both of which are 
necessary to sustain econo mic growt h.  
India’s external sector is safely navigating through uncertainties
1.43 On the external front, moderation in merchandise exports continued during FY24, mainly 
Economic Survey 2023-2428on account of weaker global demand and persistent geopolitical tensions. However, a sharper 
decline in India’s merchandise import growth, owing to declining commodity prices, resulted in 
a lower trade deficit in FY24. However, India's service exports have remained robust, reaching 
a new high of USD 341.1 billion in FY24. Exports (merchandise and services) in FY24 grew by 
0.15 per cent, while the total imports declined by 4.9 per cent despite a strong domestic market 
demand.37 Net private transfers, mostly comprising remittances from abroad, grew to USD 
106.6 billion in FY24. As a result, the CAD stood at 0.7 per cent of the GDP during the year, an 
improvement from the deficit of 2.0 per cent of GDP in FY23.  
1.44 Supported by optimism surrounding India’s growth story, progressive policy reform, 
economic stability, fiscal prudence and attractive investment avenues, India witnessed robust 
FPI inflows in FY24 that helped fund the CAD and aided the RBI in building adequate forex 
reserves. Net FPI inflows stood at USD 44.1 billion during FY24 against net outflows in the 
preceding two years. Net FDI inflows, however, witnessed moderation largely as a part of the 
global phenomenon of declining FDI flows on account of increased scepticism. Net FDI inflows 
to India declined from USD 42.0 billion during FY23 to USD 26.5 billion in FY24. However, 
gross FDI inflows moderated by only 0.6 per cent in FY24. The contraction in net inflows was 
primarily due to a surge in repatriation/disinvestment.

1.45 Overall, India’s external sector is being deftly managed with comfortable foreign exchange 
reserves and a stable exchange rate. Forex reserves as of the end of March 2024 were sufficient 
to cover 11 months of projected imports and more than 100 per cent of total external debt. The 
Indian Rupee has also been one of the least volatile currencies among its emerging market peers 
in FY24. India’s external debt vulnerability indicators also continued to be benign. External 
debt as a ratio to GDP stood at a low level of 18.7 per cent as of end-March 2024. The ratio of 
foreign exchange reserves to total debt stood at 97.4 per cent as of March 2024.

Reduction in macro vulnerability 
1.46 In its pursuit of fiscal consolidation through efficient and prudent fiscal management, 
the Government continues to stick to the fiscal glide path. The fiscal deficit of the Government 
is expected to drop to 4.5 per cent of GDP or lower by FY26. This commitment has helped 
keep the sovereign debt sustainable, thereby keeping sovereign bond yields and spreads in 
check. All these factors have combined to keep the macroeconomic environment stable and 
provide a platform for sustainable growth. This is reflected in the downward trajectory of the 
macroeconomic vulnerability index – an index constructed by combining India’s fiscal deficit, 
CAD and inflation.

Economic Survey 2023-2430Box I.2: Strengthening the Statistical System
A sound and dynamic statistical system is the cornerstone for an informed citizenry, data-
driven policies and decision-making. Official statistics play a pivotal role in addressing 
societal challenges and promoting inclusive growth. The government is taking many 
steps aimed at strengthening administrative and survey statistics, building capacities and 
improving data quality and timeliness.
MoSPI, the cornerstone
MoSPI is the nodal ministry for the planned and integrated development of the Indian 
statistical system. MoSPI anchors the core statistics by publishing GDP, price and 
volume indices and countrywide surveys of macroeconomic and sectoral importance. The 
Ministry has initiated various new surveys, namely, the annual survey of unincorporated 
sector enterprises, a time-use survey and started a pilot for an annual survey of service 
sector enterprises. MoSPI is also working towards increasing the frequency of PLFS data 
and extending the generation of quarterly estimates for rural areas. Modern IT tools are 
being adopted for improved data capturing and processing. To encourage greater use of 
administrative data, a National Metadata Structure is also being developed. The Unified 
Data Portal project has been envisaged by MoSPI with the objective of creating a centralised 
database and storage system. Ministries are also taking initiatives to enhance the frequency 
of various surveys to make more informed policy decisions. Given India’s 2047 goals, it 
is important for development policy that (a) MoSPI is capacitated fully to produce and 
integrate all required statistics with the desired quality, regularity and timeliness and (b) 
the quality and timeliness of administrative and transactional data of the line Ministries are 
brought to levels that fully facilitate timely course corrections.  
Further steps to strengthen the statistical database
a) An extensive exercise for base revision of important economic statistics is being taken 
up at MoSPI. The exercise to change the base year of CPI from 2012 to 2024 has been 
initiated. An Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics has been set up to 
decide on the base year for GDP. It is important that the base year of critical data series like 
the GDP, different price indices and volume indices like Index of Industrial Production 
(IIP) are updated to the most recent feasible year at the earliest. The ongoing efforts 
to construct the producer price index for goods and services may be expedited to have 
a greater grasp of episodes of cost-push inflation. State-level variants of indices like IIP 
will help understand the emerging geographical patterns. Survey data to help understand 
private sector capital formation at regular intervals will also help policy formulation. 
b) The high-frequency price monitoring data for essential food items collected by different 
departments may be linked in such a way that the build-up of prices at each stage from 
the farm gate to the final consumer is quantifiable and monitorable. This will help 
improve the effectiveness of administrative action by the Government to stabilise prices 
of essential food items.
State of the Economy31c) More than 1.3 crore entities are registered under GST and file returns. The granular GST 
data, if made available, has great potential to analyse the health of businesses, screening 
of loan applications, provide support for cash flow-based lending, and understand the 
economies of different geographies deeply. 
d) The XV Finance Commission observes, “The CAG, which is mandated to carry out the 
role of accounts compilation and finalisation for almost all the States, as well as being the 
auditor of both the Union and the States, is already in the process of establishing common 
fiscal data standards. This would eventually ensure the availability of standardised data 
through a public web portal for granular level fiscal statistics of the Union and the States, 
both for historic audited fiscal data and high-frequency fiscal data for the current year in 
downloadable database formats.”39 Granular time series, in database formats, of audited 
accounts of the Union and the States will make fiscal analysis and policy much easier. 
e) Regular indicators of the dynamics of production and employment in MSMEs are 
essential, considering their potential for growth and job creation. 
f) Information may be published on industry-wise gross disbursement of bank credit (as 
opposed to the data on outstanding credit currently available), industry-wise monthly 
gross financial flows through domestic and external equity and debt routes, and other 
financing sources. 
g) There is also a need to have a regular mechanism to aggregate the financial flows to 
infrastructure and physical progress- sectorally and geographically differentiated- 
achieved in different infrastructure sectors, at least on an annual basis. 
h) The large volume of data generated by schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya 
Yojana and Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, which capture details such as hospital 
admissions, patients’ medical history or demographic details. These can be used for 
disease surveillance, preventive medication, etc.
i) The Labour Bureau is also tasked with conducting five surveys relating to workers and 
employment. Ensuring rigour, timeliness and user-friendliness of data and making it 
available in database formats will help analysis and policy40.
The thrust on evidence also necessitates that the process and impact evaluation capacities 
in the Union and State Governments and universities are nurtured and driven towards 
maturity in a time-bound manner.
INCLUSIVE GROWTH
Shift in the approach to welfare 
1.47 India’s social welfare approach has undergone a shift from an input-based approach 
to outcome-based empowerment. Saturation of basic necessities has been recognised as 
imperative to achieve this, thus impelling an array of flagship initiatives. Government initiatives 
like providing free-of-cost gas connections under PM Ujjwala Yojana, building toilets under

Economic Survey 2023-2432the Swacch Bharat Mission, opening bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana, building pucca 
houses under PM-AWAS Yojana have improved capabilities and enhanced opportunities for 
the underprivileged sections.
1.48 The approach also involves the targeted implementation of reforms for last-mile service 
delivery to truly realise the maxim of “no person left behind”. These include the Aspirational 
Districts Programme, launched in 2018, for focusing efforts on the most backward regions, the 
success of which inspired the Aspirational Blocks Programme launched in 2023; the Vibrant 
Villages Programme for border areas; and more recently, the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, 
which saw the participation of 15 crore people in two months starting 15 November 202341. The 
digitisation of healthcare, education and governance helps improve the gains for every rupee 
spent. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme and Jan Dhan Yojana-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity 
have been boosters of fiscal efficiency and minimisation of leakages, with ₹36.9 lakh crore 
having been transferred via DBT since its inception in 2013 (DBT Portal.42).

1.49 On the employment front, according to the annual PLFS, the all-India annual 
unemp loyment rate (persons aged 15 years and above, as per usual status) has been declining 
since the pandemic. This has been accompanied by a rise in the labour force participation rate 
and worker-to-population ratio. Even by the relatively strict standards of current weekly status, 
employment has recovered from the pandemic in urban and rural areas. From the gender 
perspective, the female labour force participation rate has been rising for six years, i.e., from 
23.3 per cent in 2017-18 to 37 per cent in 2022-23, driven mainly by the rising participation of 
rural women.

1.50 As a result of the systematic focus on addressing individual deprivations, the incidence of 
poverty has reduced remarkably. This is reflected in the steep decline in the headcount ratio of 
multidimensionally poor between 2015-16 and 2022-23, as per NITI Aayog’s discussion paper

1.51 The initiatives in the social sector have also translated into rising consumption spending, 
as evident from the results of the latest Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 
2022-23. The HCES throws many reassuring findings on inclusive growth in the past decade. 
The monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) in 2022-23 increased in real terms 
in both rural and urban areas over 2011-12. The difference between rural and urban MPCE also 
declined in percentage terms.

Economic Survey 2023-2434OUTLOOK
1.52 The Indian economy recovered swiftly from the pandemic, with its real GDP in FY24 
being 20 per cent higher than the pre-COVID, FY20 levels. This meant a CAGR of 4.6 per cent 
from FY20, despite a 5.8 per cent decline in FY21 inflicted by the pandemic. Analysis in this 
chapter shows that the current GDP level is close to the pre-pandemic trajectory in Q4FY24. 
During the decade ending FY20, India grew at an average annual rate of 6.6 per cent, more or 
less reflecting the long-run growth prospects of the economy. This is the background against 
which we can see the prospects for FY25. 
1.53 IMF projects the global economy to grow at 3.2 per cent in 2024, with risks being broadly 
balanced. The average annual global growth was 3.7 per cent during the decade ending FY20. 
Inflationary pressures have moderated in most economies with declining global commodity 
prices and easing of supply chain pressures. However, core inflation remains sticky and driven 
by high service inflation. Many central banks have hinted at the peaking of the interest rate hike 
cycle. The ECB has already cut the policy rate, while the Fed has hinted at reducing the rate in 
2024. If the services inflation across economies moderates faster, that may allow central banks 
to bring forward the monetary policy easing cycle earlier than currently anticipated. A likely 
reduction in policy rates by central banks of AEs, especially the Fed, will open the space for 
central banks of EMEs to follow the lead, bringing down the cost of capital. 
1.54 On the downside, any escalation of geopolitical conflicts in 2024 may lead to supply 
dislocations, higher commodity prices, reviving inflationary pressures and stalling monetary 
policy easing with potential repercussions for capital flows. This can also influence RBI’s 
monetary policy stance. The global trade outlook for 2024 remains positive, with merchandise 
trade expected to pick up after registering a contraction in volumes in 2023. Conversely, 
increased fragmentation along geopolitical lines and renewed thrust on protectionism may 
distort merchandise trade growth, impacting India’s external sector. Global financial markets 
have scaled new heights, with investors betting on global economic expansion. However, any 
corrections in the elevated financial market valuations may have ramifications for household 
finances and corporate valuation, negatively impacting growth prospects. Hiring in the 
information technology sector had slowed down considerably in FY24, and even if hiring does 
not decline further, it is unlikely to pick up significantly. However, leveraging the initiatives 
taken by the government and capturing the untapped potential in emerging markets, exports of 
business, consultancy and IT-enabled services can expand. Despite the core inflation rate being 
around 3 per cent, the RBI, with one eye on the withdrawal of accommodation and another on 
the US Fed, has kept interest rates unchanged for quite some time, and the anticipated easing 
has been delayed.
1.55 Domestic growth drivers have supported economic growth in FY24 despite uncertain 
global economic performance. Improved balance sheets will help the private sector cater to 
strong investment demand. A note of caution is warranted here. Private capital formation after 
good growth in the last three years may turn slightly more cautious because of fears of cheaper 
State of the Economy35imports from countries that have excess capacity. While merchandise exports are likely to 
increase with improving growth prospects in AEs, services exports are also likely to witness 
a further uptick. A normal rainfall forecast by the India Meteorological Department and the 
satisfactory spread of the southwest monsoon thus far are likely to improve agriculture sector 
performance and support the revival of rural demand. However, the monsoon season still has 
some ways to go. Structural reforms such as the GST and the IBC have also matured and are 
delivering envisaged results. Considering these factors, the Survey conservatively projects a 
real GDP growth of 6.5–7 per cent, with risks evenly balanced, cognizant of the fact that the 
market expectations are on the higher side.
